# The Tenant Next Door

_Based on true events_

I write these words with trembling hands, not from the usual anxieties that plague my mundane existence at the West Side Fitness Center's front desk, but from the profound horror of what transpired during my ill-fated evening with Joseline Holloway from apartment 3B.

The cosmic irony of my situation was not lost on me – a 33-year-old man, bearing an unfortunate resemblance to a bloated version of a certain cartoon character, still sharing living quarters with Sarah, my ex-girlfriend, attempting to court a woman eleven years my junior. Yet Joseline possessed a peculiar magnetism that defied conventional attraction.

Our rendezvous began at that garish establishment known as "Buns," a choice I now recognize as the first step toward my doom. Ms. Holloway picked at her burger with obvious distaste, but it was her conversation that truly unsettled me. She spoke of her upbringing in her family's funeral home with an unsettling gleam in her eyes, describing ancient embalming techniques that seemed to draw from sources far older and more sinister than any modern mortuary science.

"The ancients knew that death was merely a door," she said, her voice carrying an otherworldly timbre that made my spine crawl. "My grandfather's library contained texts that spoke of... alternatives."

She leaned forward then, her half-eaten burger forgotten, and I noticed with mounting horror that her pupils had taken on an oddly rectangular shape. "You see," she continued, her voice dropping to a whisper that somehow carried over the restaurant's gaudy music, "the Egyptians were close, but they fundamentally misunderstood the purpose of organ removal. It wasn't about preservation – it was about replacement."

My french fries turned to ash in my mouth as she continued. "There are cavities within the human body that can house... other things. Things that squirm at the edges of reality. My grandfather's books spoke of sacrificial geometries, of organs arranged in patterns that form doors rather than vital systems. The heartbeat is merely the simplest of rhythms – there are more complex percussion patterns that can be achieved with a properly arranged circulatory system."

I felt my own heart stumble in its rhythm as she spoke, as if responding to some unseen conductor. The ketchup on her plate had begun to move in patterns that matched no natural fluid dynamics.

"Why do you think we pump the blood out?" she asked, her smile growing incrementally wider than her face should allow. "It's not for preservation. It's to make room for what comes next. The ancients knew that flesh was merely a vessel, and with the right... adjustments... it could hold so much more."

My stomach lurched violently, though whether from her words or from the way her skin had begun to ripple like the surface of boiling water, I cannot say. The remainder of my meal sat untouched, the burger meat now seeming suspiciously fibrous in a way that spoke of sinew rather than beef.

Later, at the seasonal haunted house attraction, I watched her examine the prop intestines with disturbing scrutiny. "Surprisingly realistic," she murmured, "though the color is all wrong. They should be more... iridescent." Her knowledge seemed to stem from places no mortician's daughter should know.

She paused before a tableau of a medieval torture chamber, her head tilting at an angle that seemed to defy vertebral anatomy. "Oh, they've got it all wrong," she sighed, approaching a rack of implements. "These tools aren't for causing pain – they're for opening doorways. See this?" She gestured to a wicked-looking hook. "In the right hands, under the correct astronomical alignments, this could separate not just flesh from bone, but reality from its moorings."

A teenage actor in zombie makeup approached us then, dragging his feet in the conventional manner of the undead. Joseline's laugh was like breaking glass. "Amateur," she whispered, then spoke directly to the performer: "If you'd seen what I've seen, you'd know the recently deceased don't shamble – they dance. It's a beautiful thing, really. The nervous system, freed from consciousness, finally able to respond to the music of the spheres."

The actor, breaking character, backed away from us with genuine fear in his eyes. I couldn't blame him. There was something in the way Joseline moved now, a terrible grace that suggested intimate knowledge of how bodies should – and shouldn't – move.

In the next room, designed to resemble a mad scientist's laboratory, she became absolutely giddy. "Now this," she said, approaching a prop operating table, "this has potential." Her fingers traced patterns on the fake blood stains, and I swear the crimson smears began to pulse with a faint light. "The human body has so many sutures and seams, you see. Like a piece of origami, it can be unfolded in ways that reveal new dimensions. My grandfather used to say that the right incision, made at the right moment, could open a person like a door into..."

She stopped suddenly, noticing my expression in the fluorescent light. "But I'm frightening you," she said, though her tone suggested this was precisely her intention. "Let's just say that these Halloween props are adorable attempts to recreate mysteries that go far deeper than their creators could imagine. Though," she added, running a finger along a plastic severed arm, "I do appreciate their enthusiasm."

It was only when we returned to our apartment building that the true horror revealed itself. As she invited me into her unit, I noticed the walls were covered not with paint, but with symbols that seemed to shift and writhe in my peripheral vision. The air grew thick with an odd, metallic scent – not the copper of blood, but something more ancient, like the taste of stars that died before Earth cooled.

"Do you know," Joseline said, closing the door behind us with a sound that seemed to echo far longer than physics should allow, "why funeral homes began the practice of viewing?" She didn't wait for my answer, instead gliding to her kitchen where she began to prepare what she called tea, though the liquid that poured from her kettle moved with unnatural viscosity and seemed to absorb rather than reflect light.

"It wasn't for the grieving," she continued. "It was to make sure the body was still there. Still... inhabiting itself." Her movements became increasingly fluid, as though her joints were merely suggestions rather than physical constraints. "You see, sometimes they would open the casket and find... something else. Something wearing their loved one's flesh like an ill-fitting suit."

The room's dimensions began to shift subtly, corners failing to meet at right angles, walls extending into spaces that couldn't exist given the apartment's exterior dimensions. On what I had initially taken to be a coffee table lay a book bound in material I refused to examine too closely, its pages covered in diagrams that seemed to move when viewed directly.

"You know," she said, her face now somehow different, older, impossibly ancient, "I've always found age gaps distasteful. They remind me of time, and time..." she smiled, revealing teeth that seemed too numerous, too sharp, "time is such a fragile construct. Especially here."

She gestured to what should have been her living room but had become a space that hurt my eyes to perceive – a geometry that suggested infinite depth while maintaining the dimensions of a modest apartment. The floor had begun to pulse with a rhythm that matched neither my heartbeat nor any earthly cadence.

"My grandfather's greatest discovery wasn't about preserving bodies," she said, her voice now containing harmonics that made my teeth ache. "It was about using them as anchors. You see, certain... entities... need a physical form to manifest in our reality. And young flesh..." She reached toward me with fingers that seemed too long, too jointed, "young flesh is so much more... pliable."

I saw then that what I had taken for furniture were in fact bodies, artfully arranged in positions that formed living sculptures, their breath synchronized in patterns that seemed to be slowly wearing away at the fabric of reality. Some wore faces I recognized from missing person posters I'd seen around the neighborhood.

The last thing I heard as I fled was her laughter, which seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once: "Don't worry about the age gap, dear. Where you're going, time is merely optional."

I collapsed into my own apartment, but it was too late. Now, each night, I hear chanting through the walls. My reflection ages decades between glances, then reverts to youth, then age again. Sarah says she doesn't notice anything strange about apartment 3B – in fact, she claims it's been vacant for years.

I know the truth now: there are things worse than death, worse than the mere stopping of time. There are spaces between moments where other things dwell, and thanks to my neighbor's forbidden knowledge, I am becoming intimately familiar with them all.

Tomorrow I start looking for a new apartment. Though I suspect that wherever I go, apartment 3B will somehow be there, waiting next door, its tenant eternally young, eternally patient, eternally... something else entirely.

And sometimes, in the darkest hours of the night, I catch glimpses of my own reflection arranging itself into geometries that should not be possible, and I wonder if perhaps I never left her apartment at all.
