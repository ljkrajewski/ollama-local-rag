*From the Personal Diary of Joseline Holloway*

How utterly mortifying to find myself standing before his door, my form fluctuating between dimensions like some lovesick teenager unable to maintain basic quantum stability. I, who have gazed into the void between stars and found it wanting, reduced to this – my otherworldly appendages practically *fidgeting* in spaces humans can't perceive.

The journey here was embarrassing enough. I'd spent three hours arranging my hair in patterns that should have driven passing motorists to madness, only to catch my reflection in a store window looking disappointingly *pretty* in a completely conventional way. Even the local stray cats, who usually arch their backs and flee at my approach, merely rubbed against my legs as if I were some ordinary person. One of them even had the audacity to purr.

I almost turned back seventeen times. I counted, using different numerical systems for each attempt, including one that only exists in the fever dreams of non-euclidean mathematicians. But every time I opened a portal to flee into the comfort of infinite chaos, I found myself instead taking another step toward his apartment.

Grandfather would be so disappointed. His spectral form had appeared in my mirror this morning, its disappointment manifesting in wavelengths that made my houseplants evolve sentience and immediately wilt from existential dread.

"My dear," he had intoned, his voice echoing from several previous Thursdays, "we are beings of cosmic significance. We do not *pine* after mortals who organize their paperclips by size and think eldritch horrors are 'just like big cats, really, when you think about it.'"

But that was precisely the problem, wasn't it? Toby's stubborn normality had somehow become more fascinating than all the forbidden knowledge in Grandfather's library. His ability to look at mathematical symbols that should shatter sanity and see "neat doodles" had done something to me that no amount of cosmic horror could undo. He had made me feel *human*.

The words that drove me to this point still echo in my mind, their memory somehow more terrifying than any of the bleeding symbols in Grandfather's books: "I don't think I'm enough for you."

The sheer *audacity* of it. How dare he decide what I deserve? I, who have read tomes bound in materials harvested from the spaces between moments, who have witnessed the birth and death of universes through mirrors ground from crystallized time, who have walked the paths between dimensions where reality itself goes to dream – reduced to standing before his door like a common supplicant.

And yet.

And yet here I am, my carefully maintained aura of cosmic dread flickering like a faulty light bulb (the comparison alone makes me cringe – I used to be so much better at metaphors involving the screaming of damned souls). 

I could show him what I am, of course. That's why I'm here, isn't it? To demonstrate exactly what he's dealing with. To prove that his "ordinary" self has somehow managed to entangle itself with forces beyond mortal comprehension. To make him understand that *he* doesn't get to decide if he's worthy of *me*.

The truly horrifying part? A small, treacherously human part of me whispers that perhaps I'm here to prove that I'm worthy of *him*.

This is what he's reduced me to – standing before his door, my various dimensional aspects practically vibrating with anxiety, wondering if perhaps being able to find beauty in ordinary things is its own kind of power. A power that might, in some ways, be greater than the ability to reshape reality itself.

The hallway lights dim around me as my form destabilizes further. For once, I'm not doing it on purpose. The mere proximity to his apartment has my eldritch nature practically squirming with what I refuse to admit might be butterflies. Not the usual kind that emerge from interdimensional portals, either, but the mortifyingly normal kind that humans get when they're nervous.

I raise my hand to ring the doorbell and notice with horror that I'm maintaining a completely normal number of fingers. I haven't sprouted a single extra appendage. Even my skin has settled into a perfectly ordinary shade of pale, without even a hint of the usual void-like depth that makes most humans uncomfortable maintaining eye contact.

Well, there's nothing for it. I am what I am – a being of cosmic horror and incomprehensible knowledge who has somehow fallen for a man who collects commemorative plates and thinks forbidden geometries are "kind of like those optical illusion posters from the mall, right?"

I ring the bell, and the sound echoes through several dimensions. Not because I meant it to, but because I'm nervous. How mortifying.

The door opens, and there he stands – devastatingly normal in a faded t-shirt with a cartoon dinosaur on it. The shirt probably holds some profound message about extinction and the temporality of existence, but knowing Toby, he just thinks the dinosaur is cute.

"Oh, hey Joseline!" His smile does something unspeakable to my quantum stability. "The hallway lights are doing that flickering thing again. I should probably tell maintenance."

Time to show Tobias P. Dobbs exactly what he's trying to walk away from. And perhaps, though I'll deny ever writing this, to discover if being simply human sometimes might not be the worst horror of all.

I sweep past him, my various dimensional aspects trailing behind me like angry cats. His apartment is exactly as I remember it – aggressively, defiantly normal. Family photos line the walls, each one documenting moments of pure mundane joy. A collection of paperclips arranged by size sits in a clear plastic organizer on his desk. There's even a potted plant that, despite my proximity, refuses to gain sentience or exhibit any signs of cosmic horror. It just sits there, photosynthesizing like it doesn't even know it's in the presence of an eldritch being.

"Listen, about the other night," he begins, running a hand through his hair in that way that makes my non-euclidean geometries wobble. "I've been thinking—"

"No," I cut him off, my voice carrying harmonics that should have shattered his windows. The windows remain stubbornly intact. "You don't get to decide if you're worthy of me. I decide who's worthy of my attention."

He blinks at me with those impossibly kind eyes. "I just think you deserve someone who can understand all the amazing things you know about. Someone who gets all those quantum physics references and ancient languages and—"

"Then allow me to demonstrate exactly what you're dealing with." I feel my form beginning to shift, my carefully maintained human appearance starting to blur at the edges. "You want to understand? Then *understand*."

With a gesture that violates several laws of physics, I tear open a portal to the void right there in his living room. The gap in reality writhes with tentacles and impossible colors, its mere presence enough to drive most humans to babbling madness.

"Oh neat!" Toby peers into the cosmic horror with genuine interest. "Is that one of those infinity mirror installations? The way it seems to go on forever is really cool. Though the tentacles are new – is that some kind of projection mapping?"

I feel my eye twitch in several dimensions simultaneously. "This is a portal to the void between realities," I explain, my voice resonating with eldritch frequencies. "A glimpse into the spaces where existence itself goes to die."

"The depth perception is amazing," he nods appreciatively. "You know, my sister's been getting into digital art. She'd love to know how you did this."

Fine. If he wants to play it that way.

I reach into the spaces between moments and summon writhing tentacles from beneath his couch. They curl through the air in patterns that should scramble his sanity, their surface shifting with colors that exist only in the dreams of dead gods.

"Those throw pillows from IKEA really do have interesting textures!" He actually reaches out to *pet* one of the tentacles. "Though I don't remember buying any in this shade of..." he squints at the impossible color, "...well, whatever that is. It's pretty!"

The tentacle, to my eternal mortification, curls around his hand affectionately. The cosmic horror I've summoned from beyond the veil of reality – an entity that has witnessed the birth and death of galaxies – is *nuzzling* him like a pleased kitten.

In desperation, I begin to transform his kitchen into a non-euclidean space. The angles bend in ways that should make his mind revolt, the walls folding through dimensions that humans weren't meant to perceive.

"You know," he says thoughtfully, watching his kitchen rearrange itself into impossible geometries, "I was thinking about reorganizing in here anyway. Though maybe something a little more practical? The coffee maker's ended up on the ceiling."

I stand there, my form flickering between dimensions, watching as he casually reaches up (or possibly down – direction has become somewhat theoretical in the kitchen) to retrieve his coffee maker. He cradles it protectively, checking to make sure none of its mundane functions have been damaged by its brief exposure to cosmic horror.

"The thing is, Joseline," he says, setting the coffee maker on what might be a counter or might be a fold in space-time, "it's not that I don't see all this amazing stuff you can do. It's that I'm just... regular. I collect paperclips and get excited about new flavors of potato chips. I organize my socks by color and sometimes I spend whole afternoons watching squirrels in the park. Next to all this," he gestures at the various cosmic horrors currently infesting his apartment, "I'm just... ordinary."

Something in my chest – that treacherously human heart I thought I'd transcended – clenches painfully. But I'm not done. Not yet.

"You haven't seen anything yet," I promise, my voice carrying echoes of forbidden knowledge. "Let me show you what I truly am."

The tentacles retreating beneath his couch pause in their withdrawal to give him one last affectionate pat before disappearing. Even the void seems reluctant to frighten him. No matter. I have so much more to show him. After all, I didn't spend centuries studying cosmic horror just to be outdone by his stubborn normality, even if that normality is becoming more fascinating to me than all the forbidden knowledge in Grandfather's library.

I straighten my spine (and several appendages that exist in other dimensions), preparing to escalate my demonstration. The fact that my hands are trembling slightly is surely just an effect of channeling too much eldritch energy. It has nothing to do with the way he's looking at me with those impossibly kind eyes, as if he's more worried about me than his own sanity. 

Time to show him how I truly see the world. 

I allow my perception to expand fully, letting the veil of mundane reality fall away. The walls of his apartment become transparent, revealing the quantum framework beneath – each atom a tiny dance of probability, each molecule a symphony of possible states.

"Your reality," I begin, my voice resonating with frequencies that make his collection of commemorative plates vibrate, "is nothing but a temporary arrangement of matter and possibility. Watch."

I reach out and pluck a thread of probability from the air, unwinding it like a loose string from a sweater. Reality ripples around us as I demonstrate how easily the fabric of existence can be reshaped. His furniture begins to drift apart into its component atoms, each piece revealing the vast spaces between particles, the infinite potential hiding within ordinary things.

"Oh wow," Toby says, watching his armchair dissolve into a cloud of quantum possibilities. "That reminds me of those high-speed videos where they take apart machines to show all the pieces. Though usually they put them back together afterward?" The last bit has a hint of hopeful inquiry, as if he's mainly concerned about having somewhere to sit later.

Frustration bubbles up through several dimensions at once. With a gesture that makes causality itself hiccup, I summon my grandfather's library into being around us. Books made of materials harvested from the spaces between moments materialize on shelves that extend into impossible geometries. Texts bound in substances that remember being alive float through the air, whispering ancient secrets in languages that existed before time itself.

"Your human sciences," I declare, as a particularly enthusiastic tome tries to nibble affectionately at his sleeve, "are like children's picture books compared to the knowledge contained here. These volumes hold truths that would shatter most human minds."

"Your grandfather must have been quite the collector," Toby says admiringly, gently patting the book that's still attempting to make a snack of his shirt. "Though maybe some archival-quality sleeves would help preserve them better? The one trying to eat my sleeve seems a bit... enthusiastic about conservation."

I feel a headache developing in several dimensions simultaneously. "These books contain knowledge beyond mortal comprehension," I insist, as another book floats by, trailing pages that ripple with impossible colors. "This one, for instance, is written in ink rendered from the essence of forgotten colors. The formulas within could reconfigure the basic forces of reality itself."

"The marbling on those pages is beautiful," he nods appreciatively. "Kind of like those paint-pouring videos my niece watches on TikTok. Though I've never seen these colors before... is it some kind of special UV-reactive ink?"

Right. Time to bring out the heavy artillery.

I draw myself up to my full height (and several other dimensions), allowing my form to shift between multiple states of being simultaneously. My skin becomes a window into the void, stars being born and dying in the depths of my flesh. Additional appendages unfold from spaces between spaces, each one moving in patterns that defy conventional geometry. My hair writhes with mathematical equations that solve for variables that don't exist in this universe, and my eyes... my eyes become windows into realities that no human was meant to perceive.

As a last-ditch effort to make him understand, because apparently I've developed a masochistic streak worthy of some of my grandfather's more experimental texts, I show him my heart.

Not the ordinary muscle that humans use to pump blood. No, I show him my *true* heart – the one that exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously, that beats in patterns that would drive mathematicians to madness, that contains within it the potential for both creation and destruction on a cosmic scale.

The heart that, against all cosmic probability, has started beating in time with his.

"This," I announce, my voice echoing from several possible futures at once, "is what I truly am."

Toby looks at me – really looks at me – and for a moment, I think I've finally broken through that impenetrable wall of normality. His eyes widen slightly as he takes in my true form in all its cosmic horror.

Then he smiles.

He stands there, surrounded by cosmic horror, reality bending and warping around him like a fever dream. And still – *still* – he looks at me with those impossibly kind eyes.

I feel my various forms tremble slightly as I pose the second question, the one that's been burning through multiple dimensions since he left my appartment that night: "The real question, Tobias P. Dobbs, is whether you think I'm worthy of you."

The words emerge before I can stop them, carrying with them flavors of vulnerability that would have my grandfather rotating in his non-euclidean grave. Me, a being of cosmic significance, asking a human about my worthiness? The sheer audacity of it makes several of my extra-dimensional appendages cringe.

But I need to know. Need to understand how this utterly normal human has somehow made me feel more seen, more understood, than all the eldritch entities I've communed with over the centuries.

The room continues to pulse with forbidden knowledge. A book bound in starlight drifts past his head, pausing briefly to try to nuzzle his ear. Time flows backwards and sideways simultaneously. And through it all, I wait for his answer, my cosmic heart beating patterns of mathematical impossibility that any sane human would recognize as simple, mortal fear.


"I never thought I wasn't worthy because of what you are," he says softly, reaching out to gently pat a tentacle that's anxiously writhing near his shoulder. "I thought I wasn't worthy because I'm so... ordinary."

He gestures at the cosmic display around us, his movement leaving gentle ripples in the fabric of reality. "Look at all this. The void between stars reminds me of the spaces between puzzle pieces – you know, that moment before you figure out where they fit? And these tentacles," he smiles as one curls around his wrist like an affectionate cat, "they move just like my mom's garden after it rains, all those plants reaching for the sun."

I feel my multiple forms falter, reality hiccupping around us as my concentration wavers.

"Even that sound," he continues, indicating the screaming of the damned that's been providing ambient background noise, "it's kind of like my neighbor's violin practice. She's still learning, but you can hear how much she loves it."

"That's the wailing of souls trapped between dimensions," I protest weakly, though I'm starting to hear what he means about the violin thing.

"And about whether you're worthy of me..." He steps closer, seemingly untroubled by the way reality warps around him. "I think that's something we should figure out together, don't you?"

My various forms shudder, dimensions rippling around us as his words sink in. I watch in horror (the normal kind, not the cosmic variety) as my carefully maintained manifestation of cosmic terror begins to... shift.

The void swirling beneath my skin starts to look less like the endless abyss and more like starlight on water. The geometric impossibilities of my extra-dimensional appendages begin moving in patterns that do, I must admit, resemble flowers swaying in the breeze. Even the eldritch symbols floating through the air seem to be arranging themselves into something suspiciously like poetry.

The realization hits me with the force of a collapsing universe: his "normality" isn't a weakness at all. It's a different kind of strength – the power to find beauty in anything, to make even the most horrible things seem somehow wonderful. He doesn't deny the horror; he simply accepts it as part of a larger, mostly benign world.

My grandfather's books, still floating around us, suddenly remind me of well-loved cookbooks in my neighbor's kitchen, their worn pages holding recipes passed down through generations. The void's tentacles, still attempting to pat Toby's head, curl exactly like the stray cat that lives behind our building. Even the screaming of the damned has taken on a certain musical quality – though that might be because it's trying to harmonize with the distant sound of his neighbor's violin practice.

I feel my cosmic heart – that impossible organ that exists in seventeen dimensions – skip a beat in a completely mundane way. Because I finally understand: being "worthy" isn't about power or knowledge or the ability to reshape reality. It's about seeing the beauty in things, whether they're cosmic horrors or commemorative plates.

And Toby? He sees beauty in everything. Even me. How utterly terrifying.

As my various manifestations of cosmic horror gradually settle, Toby's apartment slowly returns to its stubbornly normal state. The books made of flesh return to whatever dimension they usually inhabit, though one particularly affectionate tome tries to stay behind to nibble his sleeve. The void reluctantly releases its tentacles' hold on reality, though not before giving him one final, friendly pat.

"Are you sure?" he asks, straightening a family photo that had somehow ended up displaying scenes from possible futures instead of his family's past barbecue. "Are you really sure you want to be with someone as ordinary as me?"

I look at him – really look at him – with every set of eyes I possess, including the ones that exist in dimensions he can't perceive. He stands there in his dinosaur t-shirt, surrounded by the fading remnants of cosmic horror, radiating a kind of certainty that makes my non-euclidean geometries wobble.

"Do you know," I begin, my voice carrying just a hint of otherworldly resonance, "how many dimensions I've explored? How many realities I've witnessed? How many horrors I've seen that would shatter most human minds?"

He nods, absently retrieving his coffee maker from where it had drifted into a temporal eddy.

"And yet," I continue, "in all those dimensions, in all those realities, I've never encountered anyone who could look at the void between stars and see puzzle pieces waiting to be solved. Never met anyone who could make elder gods purr like house cats or turn the screaming of the damned into a symphony."

My heart – all seventeen dimensional variations of it – beats in a pattern that probably spells out mathematical proof of love in some reality. "Your 'ordinary' makes the extraordinary make sense. You don't just see the horror in beautiful things – you see the beauty in horrible things. Even in me."

He smiles that smile that makes my quantum stability fluctuate. "You're not horrible. You're just... you."

"Exactly." I reach out and take his hand, letting my fingers intertwine with his in ways that technically violate several laws of physics. "You make me feel like being 'just me' is enough, even when 'me' includes tentacles and void-touched eyes and a tendency to accidentally summon elder gods during dinner dates."

"The tentacles are kind of growing on me," he admits, then grins. "Sometimes literally."

I find myself laughing – not my usual laugh that causes temporal distortions, but something genuine and warm and wonderfully human. "See? That's exactly what I mean. You make the impossible seem normal and the normal seem magical. That's not ordinary at all."

He starts to say something, but I hold up a hand (just one – I'm keeping the others in their proper dimensions for now). "I've read books bound in materials harvested from living nightmares. I've communed with entities that existed before time itself. I've solved equations that prove reality is optional. But you?" I poke his chest gently with a finger that only slightly violates the laws of geometry. "You collect paperclips and organize them by size, and somehow that's more fascinating to me than all the cosmic horrors in my grandfather's library."

"The paperclips aren't that interesting," he protests weakly.

"They are when you talk about them." I let a small void open in the air between us, and this time I'm the one who sees it differently. "Look – the darkness between realities is exactly the same color as the steel ones you keep separate from the colored ones."

His eyes light up. "It is, isn't it? Though maybe a bit more... swirly."

As he begins to make tea – humming slightly off-key in a way that somehow makes reality itself want to adjust its pitch to match – I catch my reflection in his window. My form keeps shifting between its eldritch and human aspects, unable to quite settle on either. But for the first time, I notice something: both versions are smiling.

"Hey," he calls from the kitchen, which has mostly returned to its normal dimensions, "would you like to stay for dinner? My mom's lasagna recipe might not bend space-time, but it's pretty special."

I feel something in my chest that has nothing to do with cosmic horror and everything to do with genuine happiness. How utterly terrifying.

And perfect.

"I'd love to," I reply, watching as he navigates his now-mostly-normal kitchen with the same careful precision I use for ritual geometry. "Though fair warning – the void entities seem to really like Italian food. Remember what happened to the breadsticks?"

His laugh echoes through dimensions in ways that make even my grandfather's most forbidden texts want to join in. And as I watch him prepare dinner with the same attention to detail I use for summoning elder gods, I realize something: maybe being normal isn't about lacking extraordinary qualities. Maybe it's about finding the extraordinary in ordinary things – and the ordinary in extraordinary things.

Even in things like me.

How wonderfully horrifying.

And wonderful.

I think I need to sit down.
