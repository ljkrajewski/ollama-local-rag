*From the Personal Diary of Joseline Holloway*

The most unsettling revelation occurred tonight – I experienced what mortals call "fear." Not the delicious cosmic terror I so enjoy cultivating in others, but a primal, visceral thing that made my carefully arranged internal organs clench in most uncomfortable ways. The source of this disconcerting sensation? Concern for Tobias Dobb's continued existence in this plane of reality.

The evening had begun at one of those quaint establishments humans call "movie theaters," where we attended a showing of "Shadows in the Deep" – a supposed horror film about entities dwelling in ocean trenches. I found myself simultaneously amused and exasperated by their crude attempts to capture the true nature of abyssal horrors. The creatures they depicted had a mere three rows of teeth, and their tentacles followed the most mundane of physical laws. I've kept more terrifying entities as pets in my coat pocket.

Yet Toby's enthusiasm for the production proved unexpectedly endearing. "The practical effects are amazing!" he whispered as a particularly pedestrian monster emerged from the depths. "See how they combined traditional puppetry with CGI enhancement? That's really hard to pull off!"

I tried explaining that *real* deep-sea entities prefer to manifest in ways that cause viewers' eyes to bleed, but he was too engrossed in analyzing the technical aspects of the film to properly appreciate my firsthand knowledge. "The way they used underwater lighting really sells it," he continued, methodically working his way through a bucket of popcorn that somehow remained perfectly normal despite sitting in my immediate vicinity for over an hour.

Speaking of the concessions – I will never understand the human preoccupation with coating everything in artificial butter substitute. When I attempted to explain that *genuine* ritual unguents should be rendered from materials harvested during the dark of the moon, Toby simply offered me some of his Milk Duds. The candies remained stubbornly inert in their box, refusing to writhe or whisper secrets from beyond the veil, though I must admit they paired surprisingly well with the eldritch horrors flickering across the screen.

Toby insisted on purchasing something called a "Cherry ICEE," a concoction that bore the same relationship to actual cherry juice as the film's monsters did to true cosmic entities. The drink's unnaturally red color did remind me of certain forbidden rituals, though its tendency to cause what Toby called "brain freeze" seemed a poor substitute for the mind-shattering effects of genuine otherworldly knowledge.

When the film's protagonist finally confronted the main creature in the depths – a scene that could have benefited immensely from some non-euclidean geometry and reality warping – Toby actually grabbed my hand in excitement. The casual contact sent shivers through several of my dimensional appendages, though I managed to keep most of them properly tucked away in adjacent realities.

"Wasn't that great?" he asked as we left the theater, his face glowing with genuine appreciation for what had to be the tamest depiction of oceanic horror I'd ever witnessed. "The way they never fully showed the monster until the end? That's classic tension building right there."

I tried to explain that *real* tension building involved slowly unraveling the fabric of reality until the viewer's sanity began to fray at the edges, but he was already enthusiastically discussing the film's sound design. His joy in these simple technical achievements was so pure that I found myself reluctant to demonstrate how *actual* otherworldly entities would sound. I feared it might diminish his charming excitement about the movie's mundane audio effects.

As we left the theater, my awareness of the spaces between realities alerted me to our followers long before their crude footsteps became audible. Six of them, their predatory intentions broadcasting through the psychic aether like a poorly tuned radio. I found their attempts at stealth almost charming – as if the shadows they used for cover weren't whispering their movements directly to me.

Toby, bless his wonderfully mundane perception, remained delightfully oblivious to our stalkers, continuing his enthusiastic analysis of the film's third act. "The way they used those emergency flares for lighting in the final scene? Brilliant! Though I kept thinking the red light would attract more creatures..."

I considered mentioning that we were being followed by entities far less interesting than deep-sea horrors, but his joy in dissecting the movie's technical merits was too precious to interrupt. Besides, I was curious to see how these primitive predators would approach their intended prey.

They began their advance with what I assume they thought were subtle whistles and calls. "Hey baby, nice dress!" one of them shouted, his voice carrying all the eldritch menace of a mall food court announcement.

"Just ignore them," Toby said, his hand finding mine in a gesture that sent inappropriate tingles through my non-euclidean appendages. "They're probably just drunk."

"Aw, come on sweetheart," another called out. "Why don't you ditch the nerd and hang out with real men?"

I opened my mouth to explain exactly how "real" men look when their internal organs are rearranged into impossible geometries, but Toby gave my hand a gentle squeeze. "They're not worth it," he said, his simple human nobility making several of my auxiliary hearts flutter traitorously.

That's when their leader, displaying all the tactical subtlety of a bargain-bin demon, rushed forward and grabbed my arm. His grip would have been painful to a normal human girl, though I found myself more offended by his complete failure to acknowledge the dimensional barriers he was carelessly pushing against.

"I said," he growled, his breath carrying none of the sulfurous undertones required for proper intimidation, "why don't you come hang out with us?"

"Let her go," Toby said, stepping forward with such ordinary courage that I felt something dangerously close to human emotion flutter in my chest. 

What happened next occurred with such mundane swiftness that I almost admired its brutal efficiency. One of the miscreants – the one whose soul had the dullest aura – swung a baseball bat in a perfect arc that connected with Toby's skull. The sound it made was disappointingly ordinary, lacking even the basic harmonic resonances that usually accompany violence in my presence.

Watching Toby crumple to the ground triggered something unprecedented in my carefully cultivated otherworldly nature. I felt my meticulously maintained cosmic detachment *shatter*, replaced by something hot and immediate and distressingly *human*.

The leader shoved me against the alley wall with such mundane brutality that I almost felt embarrassed for him. If one is going to attempt to dominate another being, one should at least have the courtesy to bend a few dimensional laws in the process. His breath was hot against my neck, carrying none of the sulfurous undertones or reality-warping properties that would have made this violation at least intellectually interesting.

His compatriots formed a loose circle around us, their crude laughter echoing off the alley walls in painfully ordinary acoustics. Not a single eldritch harmonic among them. No appreciation for the art of true terror at all.

I could feel his intent broadcasting through the crude electromagnetics of his nervous system – base, primitive, mundane in its evil. This was no elegantly crafted malevolence, no carefully cultivated cosmic horror. This was the simple brutality of a predator who had never known what it meant to be prey.

How utterly presumptuous of him, to think he could violate one who had witnessed the birth of galaxies, who had read texts that drove scholars mad, who kept tentacles as pets in pocket dimensions. To imagine that his mortal hands could profane one who had traced the sacred geometries of reality itself.

But what truly ignited my rage was the sight of Toby's crumpled form on the ground behind them. Sweet, normal Toby, who had tried to protect me – me! – with nothing but his fragile human courage. Who had faced these thugs with no eldritch powers, no cosmic awareness, just simple human decency.

The leader's hands grew bolder, his threats more explicit, each touch and word betraying his complete ignorance of exactly what kind of being he was attempting to defile. How disappointing that his last moments would be spent in such pedestrian villainy.

"Now, sweetheart," he growled, his hands pawing at me with all the finesse of a newborn shoggoth, "let's have some fun."

I smiled then – not my usual smile that causes reality to hiccup, but something that made the very air taste of predator. "Oh yes," I said, my voice fracturing into frequencies that made their primitive brains vibrate in their skulls, "let's have some fun. Would you like to see what your heart looks like when it's rearranged into a beacon for the Old Ones?"

His grip on me loosened as the first harmonics of my voice penetrated his auditory cortex. I could see the confusion in his eyes as his brain tried to process sounds it was never meant to hear. "What... what are you doing?" he stammered, his voice already tinged with the first notes of fear.

I reached through the spaces between spaces, my fingers finding the delightful geometry of his circulatory system. "I'm improving you," I whispered, my voice now carrying undertones that made his companions' teeth resonate in their skulls. "Your current arrangement is so... pedestrian. Let's try something more interesting."

His scream caught in his throat as I began my work. His aorta was the first to dance to my touch, unwinding from its mundane path to trace patterns that defied euclidean geometry. I could feel his pulse accelerating as I gently coaxed his arteries into more interesting configurations, each beat of his heart now following paths through dimensions his mind couldn't comprehend.

"You seem uncomfortable," I noted as his eyes began to bulge, tracking movements beneath his skin that shouldn't have been possible. "Is something wrong? I thought you wanted to get... intimate."

His skin rippled as vessels shifted beneath it, forming symbols that predated human language. Beautiful patterns emerged across his flesh – fractals that spiraled in ways that made his companions' minds revolt at trying to follow them. His body remained perfectly intact on the outside, even as I transformed his internal geography into a lighthouse for things that lurked between realities.

"Please," he gasped, his voice catching on frequencies that human vocal cords were never meant to produce, "stop..."

"Stop?" I tilted my head at an angle that made several of his friends whimper. "But we're just getting to know each other. And you were so eager to explore my hidden depths. Now I'm returning the favor."

The veins in his neck pulsed in impossible patterns as I adjusted their flow, his blood now moving in directions that violated several fundamental laws of physics. His skin had taken on an opalescent sheen as the spaces between his cells began to widen, creating windows into dimensions that human eyes were never meant to perceive.

"There," I said with satisfaction as I felt the final patterns click into place. "Now you're perfect. A beautiful beacon, calling out to entities that make your pedestrian attempts at violation seem positively quaint."

His body hung suspended in the air now, supported by geometries that hurt to look at. His chest rose and fell in rhythms that corresponded to no earthly time signature, each breath drawing in air from one dimension and expelling it into another. The spaces between his ribs had become doorways, and through them, I could hear the first whispers of the Creeping Chaos responding to my call.

"Watch closely," I told his companions, who stood frozen in terror. "Your friend is about to become so much more interesting than a common predator."

The first tendril of the Creeping Chaos emerged through his chest, sliding through spaces that his reorganized anatomy had created. It moved with a grace that made reality shudder, its surface reflecting colors that human eyes couldn't process. More appendages followed, using his transformed circulatory system as a framework to enter our dimension.

His final scream modulated into frequencies that would have pleased the Old Ones, had they been paying attention...

The remaining thugs – those whose minds had remained intact enough to process movement – tried to flee. Their mortal legs carried them at speeds that seemed adorably slow compared to the movement of cosmic entities. The Creeping Chaos, still emerging through the portal of their leader's transformed anatomy, reached out with appendages that bent space itself.

"Oh, do stay," I called after them, my voice carrying harmonics that made their leg muscles spasm in interesting patterns. "The entertainment is just beginning."

The first tendril caught the one with the baseball bat, wrapping around his torso in a loving embrace that crossed several dimensional boundaries at once. I watched with academic interest as his body tried to occupy the same spaces it was being pulled through. The sound he made as the Chaos folded him through geometries he couldn't comprehend was quite musical – a lovely chord of terror in frequencies that made nearby windows resonate.

Two more tried to run together, displaying touching solidarity in their final moments. The Chaos, ever artistic, wove their fates together quite literally. Its appendages, beautiful in their violation of every natural law, plucked them from their linear path through time and space. I particularly enjoyed the way it braided their forms through several adjacent realities before drawing them into its embrace. Their screams harmonized beautifully as they discovered what it meant to exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously.

The fourth one actually made it to the end of the alley before the Chaos caught him. This one's end was particularly elegant – the entity seemed to appreciate his effort to escape and rewarded him with a relatively quick transition through the spaces between spaces. Though I noted with appreciation how it took the time to temporarily grant him enough dimensional awareness to fully appreciate what was happening. His mind's expansion into cosmic awareness and subsequent collapse into gibbering terror was handled with admirable precision.

Throughout it all, the Creeping Chaos moved with the fluid grace of an artist, each motion an exercise in impossible geometry. Its appendages, simultaneously solid and void, material and concept, wove patterns in the air that would have driven mathematicians to madness. The way it maintained its hold on our reality through the portal of the leader's rearranged circulatory system while reaching across multiple dimensional boundaries to collect its prizes showed a masterful understanding of cosmic architecture.

The final member of their little group – a thin man whose terror had already driven him to soil himself in several dimensions simultaneously – stood trembling before me. His mind was clearly struggling to process what he had witnessed, teetering on the edge of a breakdown that I found myself eager to choreograph properly.

"Now then," I said, my voice gentle in ways that made his inner ear bleed slightly, "let's make sure you have a proper story to tell."

I began drawing the sacred geometries in the air before him, my fingers leaving trails of what lesser minds would call "impossible colors." Each line cut through multiple dimensions, creating patterns that human eyes were never meant to track. His eyes followed my movements helplessly, even as his brain began to leak sanity through the cracks I was creating in his perception.

"Do you see how this line," I traced a curve that twisted through seven dimensions before connecting back to itself, "represents the futility of linear existence?" The whimper he produced suggested that he did, indeed, see it – far more of it than his mind could handle.

"And this angle here," I continued, sketching a corner that managed to be simultaneously acute, obtuse, and non-existent, "is particularly interesting. Note how it makes your understanding of spatial relationships quietly weep in the corner of your consciousness."

His nose had begun to bleed – a common side effect of having one's fundamental understanding of reality systematically dismantled. The way his pupils dilated to different sizes in each eye suggested he was beginning to perceive the true nature of the cosmos. The drool running down his chin carried traces of impossible colors, which I found rather promising.

"Pay special attention to this next part," I advised, drawing a spiral that curved in ways that Euclidean geometry had nightmares about. "This is the part that drove the Brotherhood of the Sacred Angle to mass suicide in 1847. Though I'm adding a little flourish at the end that I think really makes it pop."

His sanity, that fragile vessel of mundane perception, shattered magnificently. I watched with satisfaction as the pieces of his mind tried to reassemble themselves around knowledge they were never meant to contain. His screams modulated into frequencies that would have pleased the Old Ones, forming perfect harmonies with the sound of his rational thoughts crumbling.

"Go now," I said, gently turning him toward the mouth of the alley. "Go and tell others what you've witnessed." I paused, considering. "Well, try to tell them. I expect most of what comes out of your mouth from now on will be glossolalia and theorems about angles that shouldn't exist, but I'm sure you'll manage to convey the general idea."

He staggered away, already muttering equations that would drive mathematicians to drink. Every few steps, he would stop to trace patterns in the air with trembling fingers, giggling at geometries only he could now see. The way he wept at right angles was particularly satisfying.

The Creeping Chaos, ever courteous, tidied up after itself as it retreated, drawing the remains of my handiwork back through dimensions that human mathematics hadn't yet imagined.

And then, in the newly restored quiet of the alley, I heard a groan that sent totally inappropriate shivers through my non-euclidean anatomy.

"Ow," Toby said, sitting up and rubbing his head. "Did anyone get the license plate of that truck?"

I was at his side before gravity had time to object, my fingers probing dimensions to assess the damage to his mortal form. "You're injured," I said, my voice carrying undertones of genuine concern that would have mortified my grandfather.

"I'm okay," he smiled, that impossibly normal smile that did unspeakable things to my cardiac rhythms. "Just a bump on the head. Did those guys leave? Everything got kind of fuzzy there for a minute."

"They... won't be troubling anyone again," I said, helping him sit up while trying to ignore how my tentacles (carefully maintained in adjacent dimensions) were curling with worry.

"That's good," he nodded, then winced. "Though I hope somebody called the police. People like that need help, you know? Proper rehabilitation."

I stared at him, this impossible creature who had just witnessed me rearrange the fundamental forces of reality (even if his concussed brain had apparently interpreted it as something entirely mundane), and felt something terrifyingly close to what humans call "affection."

He had tried to protect me. Me, who could fold space like origami. He had placed his fragile, mortal form between me and danger without a second thought.

The truly horrifying part was how much this simple, human gesture affected me. I found myself wanting to protect him in return – not through the usual means of binding his soul to an elder god or turning his enemies into geometric impossibilities, but in mundane, mortal ways that involved things like "caring" and "emotional support."

Now, sitting in my apartment, watching the walls pulse with the heartbeats of trapped souls, I find myself contemplating the most terrifying dimension of all – love. Could this warm, squirming sensation in my chest (which I'm almost certain isn't due to the dimensional parasites I usually keep there) be what mortals mean when they speak of that four-letter curse?

I find myself wanting to see him smile again, to hear him explain away the fundamentally impossible as if it were perfectly ordinary, to feel his lips press against mine in ways that make reality hold its breath.

Grandfather would be so disappointed in me.

I think I'm going to call him tomorrow anyway.
