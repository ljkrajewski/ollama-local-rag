*From the Personal Diary of Joseline Holloway*

How utterly maddening it is to encounter a mind so thoroughly encased in the prison of conventional reality that even the most blatant intrusions of cosmic horror fail to penetrate its walls. Such was my evening with one Tobias "Toby" Dobbs, whose mundane persistence in the face of enlightenment has left me in a state of unprecedented existential uncertainty.

When the server brought the breadbasket, I saw my opportunity. With deliberate precision, I began arranging the breadsticks in the configuration that had once driven the entire Brotherhood of the Sacred Geometry to babbling madness. Each placement was exact, calculated to create intersecting angles that hurt the human mind to perceive.

"The breadsticks here are amazing," Toby said cheerfully, reaching for one that formed the crucial vertex of what should have been a reality-bending pentagon. "You have to try one."

I stilled his hand with mine, letting my fingers flow over his in a way that subtly violated the laws of physics. "Wait," I whispered, my voice carrying undertones that typically caused small animals to flee in terror. "Let me finish this... arrangement."

"Oh, are you one of those Instagram food photographers?" He smiled encouragingly. "My sister's really into that too."

I rotated the final breadstick exactly 47.3 degrees – the angle at which the human brain begins to perceive the thirteenth dimension. "This pattern," I intoned, my voice resonating with eldritch frequencies, "once drove seventeen monks into hysteria. They clawed out their eyes rather than witness its completion."

"You're really artistic!" Toby beamed, pulling out his phone. "Mind if I take a picture? The way you've arranged them kind of reminds me of pickup sticks."

I felt my eye twitch in a way that usually caused nearby electronics to explode. "The negative space," I explained, gesturing to the void forming between the breadsticks, "creates a portal through which the Old Ones once—"

"Oh hey, they're still warm!" He grabbed one, completely destroying the carefully constructed pattern, and happily dipped it in marinara sauce. "You know, I love that they serve them fresh here. Some places just throw cold breadsticks at you, you know?"

I watched in mute horror as he consumed the breadstick that had been positioned to serve as a beacon to beings from dimensions beyond human comprehension. He had somehow managed to eat it in a way that violated the sacred geometry in three different planes of existence.

"Want one?" he offered, pushing the basket toward me, the remaining breadsticks now in complete disarray. "The herbs they sprinkle on top really make them special."

"Those herbs," I said darkly, "were arranged in a pattern that mirrors the celestial alignment during the Great Conjunction of—"

"I think it's rosemary," he nodded sagely. "Maybe some oregano? Hey, you should try dipping them in the olive oil too. It's got these really nice spices in it."

I sat back, watching him cheerfully decimating what should have been a window into the howling void. The pattern that had once caused an entire monastery to convert to a religion that existed in negative space, reduced to nothing more than a pleasant appetizer. Perhaps, I thought, this was a horror beyond even my grandfather's imaginings.

"You barely touched them," he noted with concern, marinara sauce clinging to his lips in a way that should have reminded me of ritual blood but somehow just looked... endearing. "Are you sure you're not hungry?"

I felt a sensation in my stomach that I hadn't experienced in eons – something dangerously close to butterflies. How utterly horrifying.

When the waiter approached, I allowed my head to rotate precisely 180 degrees to address him, a simple demonstration that usually induces immediate cosmic terror. Toby, apparently absorbed in the menu, simply asked if I could read him the daily specials from my side of the table. The waiter, poor soul, at least had the decency to flee in horror.

Seeking to penetrate his peculiar immunity to cosmic dread, I decided to broach the subject of my grandfather's library. Surely, I thought, the mere description of his collection would be enough to shake anyone's tenuous grip on reality.

"My grandfather," I began, letting otherworldly resonances creep into my voice, "was a collector of sorts. His library held volumes that defied the conventional laws of physics. Books bound in materials harvested from the spaces between dimensions."

"Oh cool, you're close with your grandfather too?" Toby's face lit up with what I recognized as genuine enthusiasm. "Mine was amazing. He got me into stamp collecting when I was eight."

I blinked several sets of eyelids, though I kept most of them in adjacent dimensions. "These books," I pressed on, "contain knowledge that would shatter the average human psyche. The pages whisper in languages that existed before time itself. Some of them have to be chained shut to prevent them from devouring unwary readers."

"That's neat! My grandfather had this one stamp from 1918 that was printed upside down by accident. He kept it in this special protective sleeve." He pulled out his phone, either ignoring or completely missing the way reality rippled around its edges at my growing frustration. "I think I have a picture somewhere..."

"One volume," I continued, allowing a slight tentacular undertone to enter my speech, "is written in ink rendered from the essence of forgotten colors. Another requires readers to evolve additional lobes in their brains merely to comprehend its table of contents."

"Here it is!" He held up his phone, showing me a picture of an utterly mundane postage stamp. "See how the biplane is printed upside down? It's called an Inverted Jenny. My grandfather used to say it was his pride and joy, next to his grandkids of course." He chuckled warmly.

"My grandfather's pride and joy was a grimoire that exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously," I said, carefully enunciating each syllable to ensure maximum existential impact. "He used to read to me from it at bedtime. The words rearrange themselves according to the reader's darkest fears."

"Bedtime stories are the best! My grandfather used to make up these funny stories about where each stamp had traveled. He had this one from Tibet that he swore was carried by a yeti." Toby's eyes crinkled at the corners in a way that did something unspeakable to my cardiac rhythm.

"The yeti," I informed him with carefully measured eldritch gravitas, "are actually transdimensional beings who fold space-time through their fingertips. Page 278 of Volume III in the Necronomicon's appendix has quite a detailed account of their true nature."

"Right?" He nodded enthusiastically. "Grandfather would love hearing that. He always said stamps were like tiny windows into other worlds. He kept his collection in this beautiful old album with gold trim. Do you still have any of your grandfather's books?"

I felt a migraine developing in several dimensions at once. "The books are still in the library, yes. Though 'still' is a relative term when dealing with volumes that exist in a quantum state of temporal flux. Some of them haven't been written yet, while others are busy unwriting themselves from history."

"That's so great that you kept them! Family heirlooms are really special." He stirred his drink with apparently genuine contentment. "I still have Grandfather's magnifying glass. Using it always reminds me of spending weekends at his house, going through his albums together."

I found myself suddenly unable to maintain my usual subtle levitation and actually slumped in my chair. Here I was, casually discussing tomes of such forbidden knowledge that their mere existence warped the fabric of reality, and he was somehow drawing parallel comparisons to a collection of tiny perforated paper squares.

Even more disturbing was the way his obvious love for his grandfather kept making the corners of my mouth turn upward. My face had not betrayed me with a genuine smile since I learned the true name of the Crawling Chaos, and yet here I was, feeling an inexplicable warmth at his simple enthusiasm.

"Would you like to see them sometime?" I asked, immediately horrified at myself. Was I actually inviting him to view the forbidden library? The place where reality itself went to violate its own laws?

"I'd love to!" he replied with such sincere delight that I felt several of my non-euclidean appendages tingle. "Maybe I could bring my grandfather's album too? We could make an evening of it!"

The truly terrifying part was how much I found myself looking forward to it.

When our entrees arrived, I saw another opportunity to demonstrate the true nature of reality. I began my ritual with practiced precision, separating flesh from bone using techniques passed down through generations of those who understood that anatomy was more suggestion than law.

"You're really good at deboning fish," Toby commented, happily cutting into his crab cakes. "I always make such a mess of it."

"These bones," I intoned, arranging them in the sacred pattern that once summoned Czoth'Thax the Unfathomable, "will form a gateway through which the Old Ones may—"

"Oh hey, they kind of look like a butterfly!" He interrupted my incantation with such genuine delight that I felt my carefully maintained aura of cosmic dread flutter. "That's so creative!"

I blinked my visible eyes (keeping the others closed for his sake) and looked down at my arrangement. To my horror, I realized he was right – in my distraction, I'd failed to complete the angular ratio necessary for summoning elder gods. The bones did, indeed, resemble a perfectly mundane butterfly.

"I'm arranging them," I tried again, my voice carrying harmonics that should have caused mild temporal displacement, "in accordance with geometries that exist beyond mortal comprehension. Each angle represents a—"

"You know what this reminds me of?" He speared a bite of crab cake with infuriating normalcy. "Those zen gardens with the little rakes. My sister has one on her desk at work. It's really soothing."

I felt something dangerous bubbling up inside me – not the usual roiling of eldritch energies, but something far more terrifying. Was I actually fighting back a *giggle*?

"How are your crab cakes?" I asked, horrified to hear my voice emerge without a single otherworldly resonance. Just... normal. Like some kind of *regular person*.

"They're fantastic! Want to try a bite?" He was already offering his fork to me, completely oblivious to the way reality warped around it. The gesture was so casually intimate that I felt several of my non-euclidean appendages blush.

"I... yes?" The word escaped before my multiple consciousness could properly vet it. As I leaned forward to accept the offered bite, I noticed my molecules arranging themselves in completely standard patterns, not a quantum uncertainty among them.

"Good, right?" His smile was like a lantern in dark dimensions, and I found myself smiling back before I could stop myself. Not my usual smile that caused flowers to wilt and birds to fall from the sky, but something genuine and *warm*.

"It is good," I admitted, then quickly added, "Though the recipe surely pales in comparison to the feasts of madness described in the—"

"You've got a little sauce," he gestured to the corner of his mouth, "right there."

I could have shifted that portion of my face into the fourth dimension. I could have metamorphosed the sauce into a symbol of chaos. Instead, I found myself doing something utterly horrifying – I picked up my napkin and wiped my mouth. Like a *human*.

"Tell me," I said, desperately trying to reclaim some semblance of cosmic horror, "does it not disturb you to consume flesh that once dwelt in the lightless depths of the ocean's abyssal plains?"

"I mean, I usually try not to think too hard about where food comes from while I'm eating," he laughed, the sound doing uncomfortable things to my cardiac rhythm. "But I guess that's one way to look at it. You're really poetic, you know that?"

*Poetic*. Me. I who had witnessed the birth and death of universes, who had read texts that drove scholars to psychosis, who could recite blasphemous verses that caused reality itself to hiccup... reduced to *poetry*.

Even worse, I felt *flattered*.

The rest of the meal passed in a haze of alarming normality. I found myself engaging in actual conversation, my aura of menace slipping away like shadows at dawn. I caught myself laughing – not my usual laugh that caused temporal distortions, but a genuine, joyful sound. I even forgot to maintain my subtle levitation above the chair.

Most disturbing of all, I was *enjoying* myself. The part of me that remained aware of the cosmic horror of it all watched in terror as my eldritch sophistication dissolved in the face of his simple charm. By dessert, I was actually considering ordering chocolate cake instead of the souls of the damned.

The true horror was not that he seemed immune to the cosmic terrors I presented – it was that he made me forget, however briefly, that I was supposed to be presenting them at all."

By dessert, I was in a state of near panic. My carefully cultivated otherworldly nature was crumbling like so many dried breadsticks. I had caught myself *giggling* – not the haunting laugh that caused milk to curdle and mirrors to crack, but an actual, human-like giggle. The sound had escaped my lips when he'd made some utterly banal joke about parking meters, of all things.

This could not stand. I needed to reassert my connection to the cosmic horrors that had shaped my existence. With grim determination, I began the subtle gestures that would open a gateway to the Void beneath our table. My fingers traced patterns in dimensions that human minds couldn't comprehend, weaving reality like wet clay.

"Everything okay?" Toby asked, noticing my movements. "If your hands are cold, we can ask them to turn down the AC."

"I am opening," I said with carefully measured eldritch resonance, "a portal to realms beyond mortal comprehension. From its depths, tentacles of nameless horror will emerge to—"

"Oh hey, did you feel that?" He shifted in his chair, smiling. "I think the restaurant's cat is under the table. They've got this really friendly orange tabby that likes to weave between people's legs."

I stared at him in mute horror as the tentacles of an unspeakable being – a horror from beyond the veil of reality itself – gently caressed his ankles. The touch of such entities had driven stronger minds than his to incoherent lunacy. Lesser men had gone gray-haired and catatonic from the merest brush of these otherworldly appendages.

"Here, kitty kitty," Toby cooed, actually reaching down to offer his hand to the squirming mass of impossibility.

"That is not a cat," I insisted, my voice carrying harmonics that should have caused small electronics to malfunction. "It is an entity from dimensions beyond human understanding, a being whose very existence defies—"

"Aw, she's purring!" He beamed at me. "Listen!"

To my absolute mortification, the sound emanating from the portal *did* sound remarkably like purring. The cosmic horror I had summoned – an entity that had witnessed the birth of galaxies and the death of universes – was *nuzzling* his ankle like some common house pet.

"Those are the screams of the damned," I tried desperately, "echoing across the infinite void of—"

"You must be a cat person too," he said warmly. "They always seem to show up when you're around, don't they? Animals can sense good people."

I felt something inside me lurch in a way that had nothing to do with interdimensional travel. *Good people*? Me? I who had read texts that drove scholars mad, who had witnessed rituals that turned time itself inside out?

With growing desperation, I widened the portal. More tentacles emerged, writhing in patterns that should have shattered his sanity. Instead, he reached down and actually *scratched* one of them. The tentacle, to my utter humiliation, responded by curling around his hand affectionately.

"Such a friendly cat," he said, his smile doing uncomfortable things to what I had thought was merely a decorative heart. "Though I could have sworn the one I saw earlier was orange, not deep void black with glowing sigils."

"Those sigils," I managed weakly, "represent concepts that would drive most humans to lunacy."

"Yeah, cats can have some really unique markings," he nodded sagely. "My aunt had one with a pattern that looked exactly like a dollar sign. Nature is amazing, isn't it?"

I closed the portal with perhaps more force than necessary, causing a small temporal distortion that made everyone in the restaurant briefly speak in reverse. Everyone except Toby, who was busy wiping tentacle residue off his hand with a napkin.

"A little damp under there," he commented. "They must have just mopped."

I slumped in my chair, defeated. Even the Void itself, that great cosmic horror that existed between dimensions, had betrayed me. It had taken one look at Toby's guileless charm and decided to act like a common housecat. If even entities of unspeakable terror could be reduced to purring pets by this man's presence, what hope did I have of maintaining my own otherworldly nature?

Worse still was the realization that part of me – a part that was growing stronger with each passing moment – found his effect on supernatural entities somehow *endearing*. The same part that wanted to laugh at his jokes, that felt warm when he smiled, that thought maybe, just maybe, being normal for a little while wouldn't be the end of the world.

Though technically, I knew seventeen different ways it *could* be the end of the world. I just couldn't seem to focus on any of them with him smiling at me like that.

Upon returning me to my apartment, he performed what I can only describe as the most terrifying act of the evening - he pressed his lips to mine in what mortals call a "kiss." The kiss itself was a simple thing - a mortal gesture I had witnessed countless times through the dimensional viewing pools. But as his lips met mine, something *shifted* in ways that had nothing to do with the careful manipulation of space-time I typically employ. My carefully maintained cosmic awareness *stuttered*, and for one terrifying moment, I experienced reality in the crude, linear fashion of ordinary humans.

The sensation began in that vestigial organ I'd long ago relegated to merely pumping ichor through my carefully arranged biological systems. My heart - how quaint even to call it that - actually *fluttered*, sending waves of warmth through channels I'd forgotten could carry such mundane feelings. Worse still, my breath caught in my throat, not from witnessing the impossible geometries of elder beings, but from the simple proximity of his mortal form.

Horror bloomed in my consciousness, but not the comforting kind I'd refined through years of studying forbidden texts. This was a personal terror, intimate and devastating. My hands, which had traced ritual patterns that could unravel the fabric of reality, trembled from nothing more than the brush of his fingers against my waist. The ancient languages I'd mastered fled my mind, replaced by the most banal of thoughts: "He smells nice."

Most disturbing of all was the realization that the various appendages I keep folded in the spaces between dimensions were actually *curling* with pleasure, like some lovesick teenager's toes. I, who had witnessed the birth and death of galaxies through my grandfather's trans-dimensional mirrors, found myself wondering if my hair looked alright.

When he pulled away, his eyes showed nothing but warm affection - no trace of cosmic horror, no glimpse of the vast unknowable, just... fondness. Simple, human fondness. And somewhere in the depths of what I had thought was a perfectly repurposed human form, something responded in kind. A part of me - a part I had thought long since transformed by eldritch knowledge - wanted nothing more than to kiss him again.

The sheer mundanity of this desire sent shivers through all seven of my transitional forms. Here was a terror far greater than any lurking in my grandfather's forbidden tomes - the possibility that beneath all my meticulously polished cosmic awareness, my mastery of non-Euclidean space, and my communion with beings beyond mortal comprehension, there might still beat the heart of a normal human girl.

I fled into my apartment, barely remembering to use the door instead of the portal to the Void I typically keep in my coat pocket. As I write this, I can still feel the ghost of his kiss on my lips, and the even more frightening warmth in my chest that refuses to be explained away by any of the eldritch mathematics I've mastered.

He texted to say he had a lovely time. The message appeared on my phone in standard characters, despite my phone being currently submerged in a dimension of pure geometry and abstract thought. I am beginning to fear he may call again.
